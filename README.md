Welcome to my website repository. You can find the live website [here](https://sfarrens.github.io/).

## Open Source

Feel free to reuse any of the SASS *etc.* if you like. I also wrote a [blog post](https://sfarrens.github.io/blog/2020/03/06/new-website.html) providing a few details on what I did that you may find useful to get started on your own site.

## Contributing

This site has been developed for my own personal use, but if you have any comments or suggestions of things I could improve, don't hesitate to open an issue or a pull request.

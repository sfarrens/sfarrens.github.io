2021 is coming to end... Covid has made this another difficult year for everyone and 2022 promises to be just as trying. One silver lining from this situation (at least from my perspective) has been that many musicians have not be able to tour and hence have had time to focus on creating new music. A lot of great albums were released this year, here are my picks for the best of 2021.

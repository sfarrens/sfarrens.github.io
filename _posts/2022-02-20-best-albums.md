2021 was a trying year for everyone. One silver lining from this situation (at least from my perspective) has been that many musicians have not be able to tour and hence have had time to focus on creating new music. A lot of great albums were released last year, here are my picks for the best albums of 2021.

## My Top 5 Albums of 2021

### 3 Fortitute - *Gojira*

French environmentally conscientious progressive metal masters [Gojira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojira_(band)) released their seventh studio album, [*Fortitute*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortitude_(album)), in the first half of 2021 signalling the start of many good things to come. As should be expected, Gojira deliver on all of the technical complexity and crisp production that has become trademark of their sound.

### 2 Hushed and Grim - *Mastodon*

##### Another sinking stone, finds its way down below, resurface when only light will ever show

[Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(band)) demonstrate astonishing musical versatility and imagination, and are able to push the boundaries of metal with each album they release. Their eighth release, [*Hushed and Grim*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hushed_and_Grim), is no exception. Ever since drummer Brann Dailor decided to take on more lead vocal duties for the band, Mastodon have been in the unique position of having three exceptional lead singers. Primary vocalist, Troy Sanders, has never sounded so good in my opinion. It sounds like he has really pushed himself out of his comfort zone enabling him to explore new musical dimensions. On songs like *The Crux* and *Skeleton of Splendor* it feels like an emotional tide is being held back by his powerful lungs.

It may not be Mastodon's best album to date, but I love how they continue to evolve and surprise me with the directions they take.

### 1 Bloodmoon: I - *Converge & Chelsea Wolf*

##### You cut me open, but I won't let you find, what's under the surface, entombed in my mind

Metalcore veterans [Converge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converge_(band)) teamed up with gothic/folk singer [Chelsea Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Wolfe) for what was for me the biggest surprise of the year, [*Bloodmoon: I*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodmoon:_I). I was only vaguely aware of Converge beforehand and I had only discovered Chelsea Wolf a few years ago, when I saw her open for *A Perfect Circle*. I have never been the biggest fan of metalcore in general and, while I enjoy her music, Chelsea Wolf lacks the *extreme metal* edge that I tend to gravitate towards these days. This album caught me off guard as I went into it with only mild curiosity and ended up listening to it on continuous rotation for several weeks. The coarse, energetic and heavy elements that Converge bring to the table are perfectly paired with the atmospheric, moody and haunting melodies of Chelsea Wolf. It feels like musical equivalent of having some spicy, but good quality, street food (*i.e.* Converge) with a expensive bottle of wine (*i.e.* Wolf) that end complementing each other extremely well.

It may not be for everyone, but it is my pick for the best album of 2021.

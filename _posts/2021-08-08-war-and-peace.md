**Rating:** ★★★★★

It took me a while, but I finally finished reading *War and Peace* a couple of weeks ago. It was a long, but ultimately very rewarding book that I would highly recommend. In case you are interested, here is my piece on War and Peace.

## What is it?

You are likely already quite familiar, but [War and Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace) (Война и миръ) is a novel published in 1869 and written by Russian author [Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy) (usually anglicised as Leo Tolstoy). It was hugely successful when it came out and is still widely considered one of the greatest works of literature ever written.

## Translation

The original text was obviously written in Russian, which I sadly do not speak. Therefore, in this blog post I will specifically refer to the 1922 English translation by [Aylmer and Louise Maude
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aylmer_and_Louise_Maude). Specifically, I read volume 51 of the [Great Books of the Western World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World) published by the [Encyclopædia Britannica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica,_Inc.) in 1952.

While I believe this is considered to be a good translation (see *e.g.* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace#Comparing_translations)), this simply happened to be the version I had available (I believe my father found it in a charity shop in the UK for £1). If you have not already read the book, then you may want to consider which translation you want to read beforehand as inevitably some subtitles of a language are lost in translation and some translators may be better able to capture some of the nuance.

## The Plot

### Setting

The novel includes various settings, but the vast majority of events take place in western Russia during the reign of [Alexander I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Russia) (grandson of [Catherine the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great)) starting in 1805 and ending in 1820. A large portion of the book is dedicated to the year 1812, when the French army, under the command of [Napoléon Bonaparte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon), invaded Russia.

### Characters

As this is a particularly long novel, there are quite a few characters overall. That said, the most time is spent with the following protagonists.

- [Pierre Bezukhov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bezukhov): Throughout the book *Pyotr* (Russian version of Peter) is almost exclusively referred to as *Pierre* (French version of Peter) to highlight the fact he was educated in France and is therefore not quite as Russian as some of the other characters. Pierre is the illegitimate son of the extremely wealthy Count Bezukhov, who dies early on in the story leaving his title and fortune to his estranged son. He is often referred to as the primary protagonist of the novel, which makes some sense given the number of chapters dedicated to his point of view. I do, however, think this could be misleading as the narrative is really divided between various characters and events. Thus, while Pierre is a prominent character, War and Peace is not really his story. Pierre is described as being a large man, I believe implying both tall and stout. He is a socially awkward and somewhat aimless in what he should do with his life and his newfound wealth.

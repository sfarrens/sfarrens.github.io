blurb: "My picks for the best albums of 2022"

---

2023 is upon us and it's time to look back at the albums released in 2022 and see which of them are still resonating with me. There were plenty of releases last year by big-name bands, such as *Lamb of God*, *Megadeth*, and *Rammstein*, none of which really stood out for me. After much reflection, however, I managed to narrow down my top picks of the year to just five albums. As I did [last year](/blog/2022/02/20/best-albums.html), I have also included a few honourable mentions, some of which were in contention for a top spot.

Hopefully this post will inspire you to go out and listen to at least one of these bands and perhaps discover something new.

## My Top 5 Albums of 2022

Here are my picks for the five best albums released in 2022 in descending order.

> Click on the album covers for more details.

### 5 Blackbraid I - *Blackbraid* ![]({{ site.image_path }}/usa.png){:.flag}

##### Can you hear her calling, Dusks eternal blanket falls

One new discovery from 2022 (thanks to [BangerTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMxbuclqa6U&ab_channel=BANGERTV-AllMetal)) was the debut album by *Blackbraid*, [Blackbraid I](https://blackbraid.bandcamp.com/album/blackbraid-i). Blackbraid is a solo project by Sgah‚Äôgahsow√°h, who combines black metal with traditional Native American music. The end results is as unique and impactful as it sounds, which is all the more impressive given that the album was released independently.

I only discovered this gem in December of 2022, so I didn't have as much time to digest it as some of the other entries on this list, but it was enough to make into my top five albums of the year.

### 4 Starlight and Ash - *Oceans of Slumber* ![]({{ site.image_path }}/usa.png){:.flag}

[<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813J8N3TaZL._SL1500_.jpg" class="md-image">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceans_of_Slumber)

##### Can you take me to the water's edge?

I have been following [Oceans of Slumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceans_of_Slumber) since they released their second album, *Winter*, back in 2016. The incredible voice and emotional lyrics provided by frontwoman Cammie Gilbert-Beverly left a lasting impression on me. In 2022, they released their fifth studio album, *Starlight and Ash*. Immediately from the first track, *The Waters Rising*, you are presented with Cammie's powerful lungs and soulful melodies. The production on the album is balanced just right to highlight the vocals, while giving the rest of the band a chance to shine.

I am eager to see what they do next.

### 3 The Long Road North - *Cult of Luna* ![]({{ site.image_path }}/sweden.png){:.flag}

[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e4/Cult_of_Luna_-_The_Long_Road_North.png" class="md-image">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Road_North)

##### Your skull is screaming

[Cult of Luna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_Luna) is a Swedish post-metal band that has been around since the late 90s. In 2022, they released [The Long Road North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Road_North), their ninth studio album. When reviewing their EP, *The Raging River*, for my post on the [Best Albums of 2021](/blog/2022/02/20/best-albums.html), I mentioned that this album was likely to feature in my top picks for 2022 and I was not wrong. This feels more like an auditory experience than just a collection of songs. The opening track, *Cold Burn*, kicks off with a tidal wave of sound and from there on, Cult of Luna take you on an emotive sonic odyssey. A good fraction of the album is comprised of atmospheric, experimental instrumentals that explore themes of loss and melancholy. On the contrary, the vocal sections are intense and sound like the tortured howls of lost souls.

If you are a fan of bands like [Isis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis_(band)) or [Neurosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis_(band)), you will not be disappointed.

### 2 Impera - *Ghost* ![]({{ site.image_path }}/sweden.png){:.flag}

[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b0/Ghost_-_Impera.jpg" class="md-image">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impera)

##### There's a darkness at the heart of my love, That runs cold, runs deep, The darkness at the heart of my love, For you

Swedish band [Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(Swedish_band)) does not need much of an introduction; they are easily one of the biggest rock/metal bands in the world at the moment. [Impera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impera) is the band's fifth studio album and features their trademark catchy choruses and comical satanic lyrics. While this album does not quite reach the heights of 2015's *Meliora*, Tobias Forge (a.k.a. Papa Emeritus IV) continues to demonstrate his captivating songwriting talent on stand out tracks like *Spillways* and *Call Me Little Sunshine*.

Ghost may have become a bit mainstream, but they continue to deliver top quality albums.

### 1 Zeal & Ardor - *Zeal & Ardor* ![]({{ site.image_path }}/switzerland.png){:.flag}![]({{ site.image_path }}/usa.png){:.flag}

[<img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273c34c564cc80cf98e7391dd87" class="md-image">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeal_%26_Ardor_(album))

##### Where's your fucking god when you're bout to rot?

[Zeal & Ardor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeal_%26_Ardor) is an avant-garde metal band lead by the gifted Swiss-American musician, Manuel Gagneux. They have quickly become one of my favourite bands given the unique combination of black metal with African-American spirituals. The self-titled album, [Zeal & Ardor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeal_%26_Ardor_(album)), is the band's third full-length release and includes a bit of everything they do best: driving riffs, haunting melodies, surprising choices and clever lyrics. This was a fairly easy pick for my favourite album of 2022. No other album kept me guessing and peaked my interest in the same way. Some stand out tracks for me were *Run*, *I Caught You* and *G√∂tterd√§mmerung*.

If you are not already familiar with Zeal & Ardor, this album will be a great introduction.

## Honourable Mentions

Here is a short list of albums released in 2022 that I feel like are worth your time. The albums are simply listed in alphabetically order by band name.

### Rakshak - *Bloodywood* ![]({{ site.image_path }}/india.png){:.flag}

[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/Bloodywood_rakshak.jpg" class="md-image">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakshak_(album))

##### Bonafide homicide then we're gonna ride on, Up into your mind and then we're gonna fight on

Certainly one of the most fun albums of 2022, was [Rakshak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakshak_(album)) by Indian metal band [Bloodywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodywood). The band mixes Indian folk music with nu metal (with some djent vibes). There are some clear influences from bands like [Linkin Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkin_Park). Overall, listening to this album just made me smile üòÅ, and we can all do with a bit of that in our lives.

### Pagan - *Faun* ![]({{ site.image_path }}/germany.png){:.flag}

[<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pJRM2xrVL._SL1200_.jpg" class="md-image">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faun_(band))

##### Fest in der K√§lte Bann, Weht von Ferne dein Gesang

One of my favourite songs of 2022, was a collaboration between German pagan folk band [Faun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faun_(band)) and Swiss folk metal band [Eluveitie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eluveitie) on a song called [*Gwydion*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nlw0oqpO5g&ab_channel=fauntube). The track appears on Faun's 2022 release, *Pagan*. Had the whole album been as good as this song, it would have been a strong contender for a top five spot. The rest of the album is good, but lacks the heavier element that Eluveitie frontman Chrigel Glanzmann brought to this one song.

### The Majesty of Decay - *Judicator* ![]({{ site.image_path }}/usa.png){:.flag}

[<img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0639989861_16.jpg" class="md-image">](https://judicatormetal.bandcamp.com/album/the-majesty-of-decay)

##### What feeds the parasite?

I was only vaguely familiar with American power metal band [Judicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicator_(band)) prior to their 2022 release, *The Majesty of Decay*. This was the strongest contender for a top five spot and only narrowly missed out. The album is just the right amount of cheesy and fun, but the songwriting and musicianship is truely first rate.

If you are looking for some epic power metal, I think this should be your go to album from 2022.

### Patient Number 9 - *Ozzy Osbourne* ![]({{ site.image_path }}/uk.png){:.flag}

[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/59/OzzyOsbournePatientNumber9.jpg" class="md-image">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Number_9)

##### When they call your name, better run and hide

[Ozzy Osbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy_Osbourne) is continuing his career well into his seventies. In 2022, he released his thirteenth solo album titled [Patient Number 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Number_9). This is (very very) far from the best Ozzy has to offer, but it is still impressive that after all this time there are still a few decent tracks on the album, in particular the [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_6DfxA6LiI&ab_channel=OzzyOsbourneVEVO) featuring the late great [Jeff Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Beck).

### Shiki - *Sigh* ![]({{ site.image_path }}/japan.png){:.flag}

[<img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3633799207_16.jpg" class="md-image">](https://peaceville.bandcamp.com/album/shiki)

[Shiki](https://peaceville.bandcamp.com/album/shiki) (several [possible meanings](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%97%E3%81%8D)) is the twelfth release by Japanese experimental metal band [Sigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigh_(band)). I have been enjoying Mirai Kawashima's unique and experimental approach to metal for over twenty years. This album does not disappoint, in fact, I would argue it is one of Sigh's best to date. This was another strong contender for a top spot and it well worth a listen.

### √ñvergivenheten - *Soilwork* ![]({{ site.image_path }}/sweden.png){:.flag}

[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Soilwork_%C3%96vergivenheten_cover_art.jpg" class="md-image">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96vergivenheten)

##### All for a bond that can't be destroyed

[√ñvergivenheten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96vergivenheten) (The Abandonment) is the twelfth album by Swedish melodic death metal masters [Soilwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soilwork). There is nothing particularly new here. It's just another solid album by Soilwork with well written songs and the unmistakable vocals of frontman Bj√∂rn "Speed" Strid. Definitely worth a listen!

### False Light - *White Ward* ![]({{ site.image_path }}/ukraine.png){:.flag}

[<img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2447867317_16.jpg" class="md-image">](https://whiteward.bandcamp.com/)

##### Wisdom turns to water, draining through my hands

I only discovered the Ukranian band [White Ward](https://whiteward.bandcamp.com/) at the very end of 2022 (again thanks to [BangerTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMxbuclqa6U&ab_channel=BANGERTV-AllMetal)). Had I come across this sooner, I think it would have in contention for a top five spot. Their style is described as experimental post-black metal, which, while accurate, does not quite fully encapsulate the directions this albums takes. Suffice to say, if you enjoy a healthy dose of saxophone in your metal, then this album is for you.

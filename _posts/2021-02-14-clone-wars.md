I just finished watching all seven seasons of Star Wars: The Clone Wars on Disney+. So, while it is still fresh in my mind, I figured I would break down what the show is and share my thoughts.

## What is it?

[Star Wars: The Clone Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_The_Clone_Wars_(2008_TV_series)) is a computer animated TV series set in the Star Wars universe that follows on from the [2008 film of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_The_Clone_Wars_(film)) (for sake of this post I will treat the film as episode 0 of the TV series). The show takes place between [Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_II_%E2%80%93_Attack_of_the_Clones) (22 BBY) and [Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_III_%E2%80%93_Revenge_of_the_Sith) (19 BBY), and is centred around the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems (or Separatists).

> BBY = Before the Battle of Yavin, *i.e.* the final act of [Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(film)).

The show primarily follows the adventures of established characters from the prequel trilogy (such as Anakin Skywalker, Padmé Amidala and Obi-Wan Kenobi) and some characters created for the show (such as Ahsoka Tano, Captain Rex and Asajj Ventress). Overall, the narrative aims to fill in the gaps from the start of the clone wars until the events surrounding Order 66 (*i.e.* the execution of the Jedi knights).

This structure of the show is interesting in that most story arcs are groups of 3-4 episodes (in a given season) that follow a set of characters and then are followed up from season to season. Some of these story arcs take place in different time periods with no warning leaving the viewer to piece things together from context (an aspect I actually enjoyed).

The series ran for 6 continuous seasons from 2008 till 2014 and was only recently finalised with season 7 in 2020. There are 133 episodes in total (134 if you include the original animated film) all of which are currently available on Disney+.

Last year I was graciously invited to give a talk about [PySAP](/soft/2020/02/29/pysap.html) at the 30th annual Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems  ([ADASSXXX](https://adass2020.es/)) conference. It was intended to be held in Granda, which under normal circumstances would have been amazing, but was changed to a remote event for obvious reasons. Overall, I found the organisation and atmosphere to be really good and it was great to lean about the amazing software projects people are working on in astronomy.

## Abstract

During this talk I will present the PySAP (Python Sparse data Analysis Package) package, a multidisciplinary image processing tool developed in collaboration between astrophysicists and biomedical imaging experts at CEA Paris-Saclay through the COSMIC project. I will provide some background on the core mathematical tools implemented in PySAP as well as demonstrating some of the diverse applications such as galaxy image deconvolution and magnetic resonance image reconstruction. I will also endeavour to relate how we managed the development of this package. Finally, I will conclude by sharing our plans for the future of PySAP and how this may impact other imaging domains.

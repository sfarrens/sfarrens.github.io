This tutorial is comprised of a series of <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target_="blanck">Jupyter notebooks</a> with simple demonstrations and exercises.

All code blocks are provided in Python (support for >=3.5) and the number of external packages required to run the examples has be kept to a minimum. All of the code has been clearly presented inside the notebook at least once to avoid the use of any "black boxes" for solving the problems presented.

In order to run the tutorial notebooks tutees will need to have the following installed:

* <a href="https://www.python.org/" target_="blank">Python</a> (require >=3.5)

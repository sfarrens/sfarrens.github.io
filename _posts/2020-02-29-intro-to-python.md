This tutorial is comprised of a series of <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target_="blanck">Jupyter notebooks</a> with simple demonstrations and exercises.

All code blocks are provided in Python (support for >=3.5) and the number of external packages required to run the examples has be kept to a minimum. All of the code has been clearly presented inside the notebook at least once to avoid the use of any "black boxes" for solving the problems presented.

### Requirements

In order to run the tutorial notebooks tutees will need to have the following installed:

* <a href="https://www.python.org/" target_="blank">Python</a> (require >=3.5)
